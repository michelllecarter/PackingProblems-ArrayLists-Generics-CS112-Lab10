Lab 10: ArrayList + Generics (Packing Problems)
Ellen Ochoa and her fellow astronauts need help preparing for their mission STS-96. Your job is to make sure all the items required are accounted for and are ready for departure. Three arrays of items have been provided for you. They are the default items that are brought on every mission, however there are special items we are taking on STS-96 and you need to make sure everything gets on board.

Given:

Three classes: Food, Supplies, Parts; with Food and Parts being derived from Supplies.
Three array's that you will have to convert to ArrayList's and copy all elements over.
You will only need to work in the Transfer class and Inventory class. You do not need to worry about Main or Setup.
Steps
First and foremost, we have to get all the data from our array's in the Transfer class into three new ArrayList's from the List interface. Create three ArrayList's called foodList, partsList, and suppliesList and set the type in the diamond <>as <Food>, <Parts>, and <Supplies>. Once these are created, edit the Transfer default constructor to copy all the items from our array's into our lists. Note : There is a printLists() method at the very end of Transfer which does the job of printing all our list items in a nicely formatted table. Once you have created the lists, be sure to go to that print method and delete the multi-line comment symbols so you can use the method! Run the program and naviage to -> View Lists to see if you did it correctly.
Once our three ArrayList's have been made, you will see a method in Transfer called addItems() where we have used Scanner inside the method to gather user input from the console and create Food, Parts, and Supplies objects. All you have to do is add these new objects to the appropriate lists using the add() method for List. Once addItems() is complete, run the program and use the console to navigate through the menus Edit Lists -> (any) List -> Add to List. There should be no reason to edit the Main method as the only information it passes in is the listNumber and that is handled for you. Add the below items to their appropriate lists. Also, don't forget to add Ellen Ochoa's favorite instrument. She'd be pretty upset if we forgot it! Note : Check the article to find out which instrument to add!
FOOD:
Pears, Perishable True, Qty 20
Hot Sauce, Perishable False, Qty 5
Chocolate, Perishable False, Qty 30
PARTS:
Copper Tube, Qty 50, 10053
Kevlar Strap, Qty 30, 10040
Titanium Bolts, Qty 45, 10032
SUPPLIES:
Sleep Mask, Qty 10
Book, Qty 5
"Ochoa's Instrument", Qty 1
Go to the Inventoryclass and make it generic with a bounded type for <T extends Supplies> so that it will work with any type inherited from Supplies so that we will be able to access the getName() and getQuantity() methods from the Supplies class. Be sure to populate it with the instance variable, constructor, and get/set methods.
Go back to our Transfer class and create three new Inventory objects with our specific types in the diamond: <Food>, <Parts>, <Supplies>.
Now that our Inventory objects are created in Transfer, go back to the Inventory class and create a method that inputs a List<T> and a String name as parameters. Have it search the List and use the getName() method to see if the input name matches any objects in our list. If it does, return the index of an object. Name this method searchByName(). Remember, our generic variable T extends Supplies, so we can use Supplies methods on T because it is being interpreted as a Supplies object.
Once the searchByName() method has been complete in Inventory, you shouuld be able to use it in the method removeItems() in the Transfer class and use the List method remove() to remove items by index returned from searchByName().
Write one final generic method in Inventory.java that looks inside any of our lists and checks to see if the quantity we want for a certain object matches what is present in our list. Call it checkQty(). This method should input the List, int desiredQuantity, and String name. Hey, didn't we just write a method that searches a list by name? Maybe we can use it to return the index of the object we want to find? That would be much easier to handle to change the quantity within the list. Let's try it!
Once your checkQty() method is complete, implement this generic method in our Transfer class method editQuantity(). Once that is done, run the program and navigate in the menus to Edit Lists -> (any) List -> Edit Quantity and check the following items by name and enter the desired quantity.
FOOD:
Bread - new Qty 20
Orange - new Qty 30
Protein Bar - new Qty 30
PARTS:
Steel Truss - new Qty 4
Solar Panel - new Qty: 25
Steel Panel - new Qty: 4
SUPPLIES:
Laptop - new Qty: 9
Sleep Restraint - new Qty: 5
First Aid Kit - new Qty: 5
And that should be it. Thanks a lot for your help with this. It certainly saved us a precious time getting things ready for our mission. Ochoa would be proud!
